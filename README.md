Toronto Crime Analysis and Prediction through Machine Learning

The Problem:

Prevent crime before it happens

Crime prediction has always been subject to continued research in many parts of the world and has particularly garnered interest in Canada. Crime prediction is a law-enforcement technique that uses data, and machine learning for the identification of crimes most likely to occur. Toronto is one of the most populous, ethnically diverse, and multicultural urban cities in Canada. The capstone project proposes to analyze crime and build predictive models to predict crime in Toronto. 

Key research questions

Predict the category of crimes that occurred in Toronto
Explore the dataset and conduct an analysis to understand crime trends and answer key questions such as :
Top crimes committed by type - number and trends
Understand crime hotspots in Toronto

The dataset

For this capstone project, Toronto crime data for the past 6 years i.e 2014-2019 is made available and open by the Toronto Police Service public safety data portal. Link to this dataset can be found here: http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/mci-2014-to-2019/data

The raw data is also saved as an Rdata file in this repository - see filename (capstonedataset.Rdata)

To load the object from the file use load("capstonedataset.Rdata") in R

The techniques proposed

A supervised prediction technique, namely, classification can be utilized to create a predictive model that can accurately predict the category of crimes in Toronto. The techniques will also cover to include pattern identification, prediction, and visualization.
